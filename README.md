# WhenLifeGivesYouLimonJustSimon

Introduce the Project:
> In this project I seeked to recreate the classic short-term memory skill game, Simon.
> The game combines a sequence of visual and audio elements to engage the player.

Rules:
> To clear each round of the game, players have to memorise the sequence of buttons activated and click the game buttons accordingly.
> Pressing the wrong button (in this remake of the game) will reset the player's progress to the start

Game Components:
> The game has 6 buttons that can be interacted with, namely:
> Start button: Clicking on this button will start the game.
> Reset button: Clicking on this button, *after the full sequence for the round has flashed*, will set the game back to the starting round.
> Red button: Clicking on this button will register the player's input, a click on the red button. 
> Blue button: Clicking on this button will register the player's input, a click on the blue button. 
> Yellow button: Clicking on this button will register the player's input, a click on the yellow button. 
> Green button: Clicking on this button will register the player's input, a click on the green button.

Main Components of Code:
> HTML: Builds the structure of the game, namely the buttons. 
> CSS: Styles the layout of the page and positions elements on the page.
> JS: Code to create Game Logic and manipulate DOM Events for the interactivity of elements on the page.
